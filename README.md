Edit
npm install
 Run a Local Server
To use the app in the browser, you need to run a local server (such as Apache, http-server, or a similar option).

 Running Tests
To execute unit tests, run:

sh

npm test
This will run Jest tests for API calls and error handling.

 Notes:
Ensure you have Node.js installed before running npm install.
The config.js file is ignored in Git for security reasons. You must create it manually.
If you experience CORS issues, ensure you are running the project on a local server.
 Enjoy building and improving the app!
